Rules of Wordle.
A word made up of 5 letters. 
You need to guess it in 6 attempts. If the letter is painted yellow, then the letter is in the hidden word, but it is in the wrong position.
If it is in that position, it turns green. If the letter is not colored in any way, it is not in the hidden word.
